# Corependium
A small place to group up samples, examples and proofs of concept regarding various Node environment-related ideas.

## Why though
As a developer, one would figure there's so much time you have to learn things, and sometimes you might even forget them after a while. Development workflow is always changing and improving, and with that, this repository tries to serve as a library, a way to archive ideas and techniques, be them very specific, or just as mundane as a Hello World.
